	<p>
	The initial concepts for MoodSwing emerged around the middle of July, 2010. The basic role of the player in the game is that of an NGO 
	leader who would mitigate conflicts between the state and the people. He does this by playing a Tower Defense game, wherein the <em>"map"</em> 
	would be the city where the player is currently serving, the <em>"enemies"</em> would be rioting people, the <em>"base"</em> would be the city 
	hall, and the <em>"towers"</em> that would <em>"kill"</em> the <em>"enemies"</em> would be service buildings that would address the concerns 
	of the rioters and prevent them from marching on towards the city hall. The core feature of the game from which every other idea for the game 
	sprang from is that the color of the city would change to indicate its health.
	</p>
	<p>
	That idea was soon extended to the aural level too: the music would match the <em>mood</em> of the city. On late July, the title
	<em>MoodSwing</em> was coined, and play upon the term became the unifying theme of the design. Early ideas about the story, which were 	
	discussed on August, were centered upon a swing in a local park.
