	<h2>The Game Spec (Late September to Mid-November, 2010)</h2>
	<span id = "jump"><a href = "#updates">Jump to Updates</a></span>
	<h3>System</h3>
	<p>
	This game will be developed primarily for the PC only. (An Xbox version may be possible but it may lead to issues in the user interface as the 
	primary way for the player to manipulate the game world is through the mouse.)
	</p>
	<h3>Players</h3>
	<p>
	Each player can play alone or with any number (unlimited) of other players through LAN. In single player mode, the player plays with the game 
	system &mdash; that is, no computer player AI systems will be required. In multiplayer mode, the player will play with other human players 
	cooperatively.
	See <a href = "designnotes.html#coopmultiplayer">Note on Cooperative Multiplayer Mode.</a>
	</p>
	<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
	<p>
	The setting of the game is an urbanized city in a modern-postmodern earth. As such, the look and feel of the game must resemble the dominant 
	art styles present in the modern-postmodern world &mdash; minimalist, surrealist, Dadaistic, etc. (Probably not too minimalist as to not be 
	too similar to Wildfire.) It is important that the original models and textures be in bright colors so that the manipulation of the hue and 
	saturation as one of the features of the GUI be effective. Despite the seriousness of the theme, however, the game is supposed to be fun and 
	cuteness and pleasantness to the eyes must not be compromised. Similar concerns are also applicable to the background music.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "macrogame">Macro-aspect Gameplay</h3>
	<p>
	Each installation of the game entitles each player to his own city (one game world) with an overall mood rating. Each city will consist of 
	several districts.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some of the districts will be part of the "Save the World" mode. These districts are an integral part of the game and represent the levels of 
	the game. Some levels will be locked at the beginning and are unlocked based on how the player is doing in the earlier levels. Levels will not 
	be arranged linearly, although some partial ordering might be necessary in order to supplement a narrative. Players may return to the 
	districts that he or she has played before in any way he or she wants. For "Save the World" mode, players will be given explicit goals to 
	achieve, with the effect of making an RTS game emerge.
	</p>
	<p>
	The other districts will be part of the "Endless" or "Sandbox" mode. New districts may be made and the only limitations to the number of 
	districts a player may create is hard drive space. Players may save their districts and resume playing them later (state-saving, as opposed to 
	the "Save the World" mode, where pregiven districts are either reset or made to manage themselves when the player is not actively playing 
	them). In this mode, players will not be given explicit goals to achieve. The player here may act freely, although with certain limits of 
	course, with the effect of making a simulation game emerge.
	</p>
	<p>
	Thus, using the same concept of a district, two entirely different gaming experiences are possible, simply by manipulating the explicity of 
	the goals. Both modes will affect the overall mood rating of the city. This overall mood will be responsible for determining how the narrative 
	conflicts resolve or how certain parts of the plot are explained (hopefully removing narrative linearity). It is quite challenging to provide 
	an infinitely looping story so that the game can virtually possess an infinite replay value, therefore, tentatively, a narrative with specific 
	closure points will be implemented for this game.
	</p>
	<p>
	Mini-games will also be introduced into the game. These games will be patterned after common PC arcade games. Certain mini-games, when 
	completed by the player, will allow the player to take an advisor or an influential person (powerups) with him to the districts (including the 
	sandbox districts).
	</p>
	<h3 id = "gamesetup">Game Setup</h3>
	<p>
	Whether it is the male lead or the female lead who the player encounters first, encounters more, and prioritizes will be determined randomly 
	(unless there arises better ideas on how to do this). At the beginning of the game, the "Save the World" mode will only have one district 
	unlocked. Later districts will be unlocked in a tree-like manner. Also, available controls or commands for the "Save the World" mode will be 
	initially limited and gradually increased to promote smooth learning curves for the players. The "Sandbox" mode will not have these 
	restrictions though.
	</p>
	<p>
	Because the player can choose to return to visited districts and can choose to visit districts in almost any order, there will be a great 
	demand for the level designer to integrate the linearity of the in-game tutorials with the non-linearity of the player's selection of the 
	levels. Of course, the necessity of a linear in-game tutorial is still open for debate.
	</p>
	<p>
	The initial overall mood of each player's city will be somewhere below average.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "gameobjectives">Game Objectives</h3>
	<p>
	It will be up to the player whether or not he or she wishes to fulfill a happy ending for the narrative. The natural impulse for players to 
	perceive completing the story as a clearly-defined objective will be difficult to avoid though. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Certain awards may be given to players for achieving certain things in the game. Casual gamers may completely ignore the award collection, 
	while hardcore gamers may aspire to collect all or some of the awards. Awards are distinguished from powerups in that awards do not help the 
	player in any way in terms of gameplay (except for motivational boost maybe), and that awards are usually obtained by doing certain actions in 
	the "Save the World" or "Sandbox" main game modes while powerups are usually obtained by completing mini-games. Awards can be represented as 
	pieces of a picture, as medals, as ribbons, etc. These awards can then be viewed by the player from a certain "Gallery" or "Folio."
	</p>
	<h3>Game Entities</h3>
	<p>
	All of the characters in the story are humans. The main characters in the story are the male lead, the female lead, and the player. The side 
	characters are the advisors and influential people that the player may meet if he or she chooses to play the mini-games.
	</p>
	<h3>Game Features</h3>
	<p>
	The user interface is designed to simulate mood &mdash; changes in graphics and in background music replace glowing bars to represent the mood 
	of the city. This is one of the central features of the game. The other central feature involves the swinging behaviour of the presentation of 
	the narrative, hand in hand with the greater amount of freedom given to the player in terms of the order in which he wishes to play the levels.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "gamerules">Game Rules</h3>
	<p>
	The macro-aspect rules of the game are less limited than the micro-aspect, level-specific rules. There are only three basic rules when it 
	comes to macro-aspect gameplay: 
	<ol>
		<li>Playing districts, both single player and multiplayer, both "Save the World" and "Sandbox" mode, will affect the overall mood of each 
			player's city. </li>
		<li>The interface and the narrative is presented to the player in relation to the order in which the player plays the level and to the 
			player's overall mood at certain times.</li>
		<li>The player may reset the game.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Interactivity</h3>
	<p>
	Even in the "Save the World" mode, it would be ideal to avoid explicitly telling the player that he has to save the world. Perhaps that the 
	first tutorials should be about how the player is supposed to earn money in the game world, and in line with that, the story begins with the 
	player assuming a completely capitalist stance. That is, the need for the player to save the world must be presented gradually and must 
	parallel the player's immersion in the game: 
	<ol>
		<li>The player is completely indifferent about the condition of the MoodSwing world initially.</li> 
		<li>The player is then invited by his old friend to visit the local park and to his dismay sees the factory instead.</li>
		<li>The player then meets another old friend of his (either the male or female lead) and begins to feel the urge to help.</li>
		<li>This sense of responsibility is built up through the levels. Of course, the player may choose to not save the world at all, which the 
			game system can find out about by evaluating the player's actions in the levels, but he has to see the consequences of such a choice – 
			a sad (not necessarily ugly) ending.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	To achieve interactivity in the game, the narrative will be presented to the player as conversations with the player, ideally not as cutscene 
	conversations, but rather conversations occuring during the levels themselves. The player may access these conversations by selecting certain 
	attention-seeking objects on the map. The curious player will most likely notice these objects and hence select them to reveal more of the 
	story.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "microgame">Micro-aspect Gameplay</h3>
	<p>
	Each district will consist of many interlocked streets (cyclical digraphs). The edges of these streets will be populated with buildings or 
	other establishments on either side. One of the most important buildings in each district will be the district hall. The district hall may be 
	situated anywhere on the district where any building is allowed to be situated. The actual placement will depend on the level design. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Many of the other different buildings may be rented by the player for buildings that generate him funds and volunteers, and for buildings that 
	help improve the mood of the city and that help mitigate ongoing riots. The player basically has three resources in each level: funds, 
	volunteers, and mood. Funds allow the player to rent more buildings and to upgrade his current buildings. Volunteers must be assigned to 
	buildings (can be done by AI) in order for those buildings to function, including fundraising buildings. Volunteers increase over time 
	according to how the player is doing in the level, and volunteer centers would help in the recruitment of more volunteers. Mood is the overall 
	health or happiness level of the district which the player is in. Buildings that help stop ongoing riots will generally also be beneficial to 
	the mood of the city. There are two ways by which a player's district's mood may decrease: pollution level and successful riots. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Pollution is caused by the other buildings in the district which are not owned by the player (although the player's buildings may also cause 
	pollution). The player can reduce pollution in two ways: by respectfully asking the owner of the problem-causing buildings to use more 
	efficient systems or to relocate (which requires spending on the player's part), or by creating competition against the owners of the 
	problem-causing buildings, driving them out of business, and then applying the efficient systems with his own building (which makes it more 
	financially beneficial to the player but is more risky).
	</p>
	<p>
	Riots begin when certain individual citizens living in the district go around to share his ideas through oration. Riots progress toward the 
	district hall, and will continue to increase in size until it reaches its destination. Thus, riots that begin far away from the district hall 
	will take a longer time to become successful (reach the hall), but will be larger and will have a greater effect on the mood of the district 
	than riots that begin close to the district hall. This trend may not be always followed. It is up to the level designer to impose how long a 
	rioting group goes around in circles before progressing toward the district hall. Using the basic rule, however, players will be facing a 
	certain dilemma (at least early game): whether to place his problem-solving buildings far from the district hall so that massive riots are 
	avoided altogether, or to place them near the district hall so that riots that do begin near the hall do not go unguarded.
	</p>
	<h3>Level Setup</h3>
	<p>
	Each district is randomly generated. Citizens spawn randomly from different buildings in the city and will start walking randomly around the 
	city. Each citizen will have a riot timer. When this timer reaches zero, the citizen will start orating and form riots. It is thus the 
	player's decision on how long he should stay on the level: stay too long and riots will become unmanageable as more people start spreading 
	ideas like wildfire, stay too short and the district may not have improved that much yet in terms of mood.
	See <a href = "designnotes.html#randomdistrict">Note on Randomly Generated Districts</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	The player will be given an initial amount of funds and volunteers to begin with. The mood of each district will begin at a percentage value 
	specified by the level designer. Any powerups that the player has brought to the district will be set-up as well.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "levelobjectives">Level Objectives</h3>
	<p>
	Each district begins with an initial mood level and ends with a final mood level. This final mood level will affect the macro-game, as 
	described above.
	</p>
	<p>
	Given that riots are like time bombs, finishing each level with a satisfactory mood level will be quite easy and will be suitable for casual 
	gamers. Finishing each level with an optimum mood level will be quite challenging and will please hardcore gamers.
	</p>
	<p>
	The sandbox mode will have none of these explicit objectives – the objectives may be set by the players themselves.
	</p>
	<h3>Level Entities</h3>
	<p>
	Each level will involve both, one, or none of the lead characters, plus any non-lead characters that may or may not be crucial to the 
	development of the narrative. (Let's not forget the player and his advisers and influential friends, of course.)
	</p>
	<h3 id = "levelrules">Level Rules</h3>
	<p>
	Each district is governed by a fairly simple set of rules:
	<ol>
		<li>Districts begin and end with certain mood levels, and the player may choose to leave the district at any time.</li>
		<li>Rioting citizens are like time bombs, and when they explode, are like magnets moving towards the district hall.</li>
		<li>The government is utterly corrupt and can do nothing to help the citizens. They will only ask the police to forcefully stop the riots 
			and in doing so, decrease the mood of the district. (In simple words, riots that reach the district hall decrease mood.)</li>
		<li>Larger riots cause larger decreases in mood when they become successful.</li>
		<li>Players can stop riots by renting any of the free lots on the district and creating problem-solving centers for the citizens.</li>
		<li>Problem-solving centers cost money.</li>
		<li>Pollution also lowers mood.</li>
		<li>Players can stop pollution by paying money to the pollution causers, or by driving them out of business.</li>
		<li>Business establishments cost money and pollution.</li>
		<li>Both business establishments and fundraising buildings generate and cost money, but the latter does not cause pollution.</li>
	    <li>Volunteers contribute to the funds of the player and are also necessary for operating the
			buildings. Volunteers increase over time and their increase may be sped up by volunteer
			centers (which also cost money).</li>
	    <li>Buildings may be upgraded.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	Rules 1 and 10 will be presented to the player first, follwed by either rules 2 to 6 and 11, or 7 to 9 depending on certain actions performed 
	by the player. The remaining rules are then finally presented to the player, with rule 12 being the last presented.
	</p>
	<h3>Level Design</h3>
	<p>
	The level designers concerns will primarily be on the size of each district, on the denseness of the districts (number of buildings over 
	number of streets), on the speeds of the citizens, on the initial mood level of the district, on the initial pollution level of the district, 
	on the climate and weather of the district (not a crucial feature of the game), on the percentage of problem-causing buildings to total lots, 
	and on the NPC's present in each district.
	</p>
	<h3>Interface</h3>
	<p>
	Control panels must be kept to a minimum. A small side panel would probably suffice to contain all the essential information that the player 
	needs that cannot be found on the map such as the minimap, funds, and free/total volunteers, and for the commands to exit from a district, 
	save the game, etc. Many of the other commands are building-specific (rent, stop renting, upgrade, assign volunteers, ask to use efficient 
	systems, ask to relocate), and are better presented in pop-up boxes above those buildings, similar to how object interaction is performed in 
	the Sims trilogy. Pollution and mood will be represented using the graphics and the music. Numbers revealed to the player will be kept to a 
	minimum as to not overwhelm the player.
	</p>
	<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
	<p>
	Random city generation, adapting background music, and pathfinding riots will probably be the most difficult to implement for MoodSwing.
	</p>
	<h2 id = "updates">Updates</h2>
	<h4>Early November, 2010</h4>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#macrogame">Macro-aspect Gameplay</a> &mdash; Each game will now accomodate multiple profiles so that people who 
	share computers may play their own cities without messing up the cities of the other players. Each player may delete/reset their profiles.
	</p>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#gamerules">Game Rules</a> &mdash; Each player may create one or several profiles. A player may play Save the World 
	Mode, which is linked to a profile and affects the overall city mood that is linked to the profile. A player may also play Sandbox Mode, 
	which is not linked to any profile. Each profile may be reset or deleted.
	</p>
	<h4>Mid-October, 2010</h4>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#macrogame">Macro-aspect Gameplay</a> &mdash; The Sandbox Mode will no longer be dependent/affecting the main city. 
	Sandbox games also need not be connected to a profile. Mini-games have been scrapped out of the game. In place of these will be meta-games, 
	or secondary objectives, which also yield powerups.
	See <a href = "designnotes.html#independentsandbox">Note on Independent Sandbox Mode.</a>
	See <a href = "designnotes.html#minigamescrapping">Note on Scrapping the Mini-games.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#gameobjectives">Game Objectives</a> &mdash; Awards have been (tentatively maybe) scrapped out of the game.
	See <a href = "desingnotes.html#folioscrapping">Note on Scrapping the Award Folio/Gallery Feature:</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#entities">Game Entities</a> &mdash; replace <em>mini-games</em> with <em>meta-games</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#microgame">Micro-aspect Gameplay</a> &mdash; Redefinition of pollution: pollution is defined as any shortcoming from 
	the ideals of the UN Millenium Development Goals. Thus, pollution in this sense is not limited to environmental pollution. Competition 
	against the polluting industries in each district will no longer be supported. Instead, they will "voluntarily" move out of town or become 
	"unpollutive" if the player is doing a good job at improving the mood of the district he or she is in.
	</p>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#levelobjectives">Level Objectives</a> &mdash; The player may leave the district any time he or she wants to. When he 
	or she does, the state of the district is automatically saved. In addition to the primary objective of improving the mood of the districts, 
	the player may opt to accomplish the secondary objectives: the meta-games.
	</p>
	<p>
	A total revamping of the <a href = "#levelrules">Level Rules:</a>
	<ol>
		<li>Districts begin and end with certain mood levels, and the player may choose to leave the district at any time.</li>
		<li>Rioting citizens are like time bombs, and when they explode, become like magnets moving towards the district hall. These time bombs
			explode faster if the mood of the district is lower and if the district has been in a bad mood for longer times.</li>
		<li>The government is utterly corrupt and can do nothing to help the citizens. They will only ask the police to forcefully stop the riots 
			and in doing so, decrease the mood of the district. (In simple words, riots that reach the district hall decrease mood.)</li>
		<li>Larger riots cause larger decreases in mood when they become successful.</li>
		<li>Pollution lowers mood.</li>
		<li>Players can stop riots and pollution by renting any of the free lots on the district and creating problem-solving centers for the 	
			citizens.</li>
		<li>Problem-solving centers cost money.</li>
		<li>Business establishments cost money and may or may not cause pollution.</li>
	    <li>Volunteers contribute to the funds of the player and are also necessary for operating the
			buildings. Volunteers increase over time and their increase may be sped up by volunteer
			centers (which also cost money).</li>
	    <li>Buildings may be upgraded.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h4>September 24, 2010</h4>
	<p>
	Under header <a href = "#gamesetup">"Game Setup"</a> &mdash; The lead character whom the player encounters first and more often and whom more
	priority will be given to will no longer be determined randomly. Instead, it will be chosen based on who the player interacts with first.
	See <a href = "designnotes.html#leadrandomization">Note on Removing the Randomization Involved in Choosing which Lead character the Player 
	Focuses on</a>
