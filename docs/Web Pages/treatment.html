	<h2>The Initial Treatment (Late September, 2010)</h2>
	<span id = "jump"><a href = "#updates">Jump to Updates</a></span>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
	Each player takes the stance of a non-government organization leader. The player is then given the challenge to solve the conflicts in a 
	certain city. The overarching conflicts mirror the issues of the modern-postmodern world – technology versus ecology, people versus state, 
	gender wars, and many more. 
	</p>
	<p>
	MoodSwing will be composed of several levels, each level representing a district wherein the player must resolve certain issues and help 
	change the world (one district at a time). The main game will be a tower defense-style RTS game, one wherein the player tries to mitigate 
	conflicts between rioting citizens and the district government by "attacking" the citizens with certain "towers," buildings that will address 
	the specific needs of the members of the riot, and which will hopefully dissolve the riots.  The goal of the player in each level then is to 
	prevent riots from reaching the "base," the district hall. The ultimate goal of the player will be to finish each level, in no particular 
	order. (The order in which the player chooses to finish the levels might be used as a basis as to how the story is presented to the players). 
	Optional mini-games (possibly several variations of other popular arcade games) will also be implemented in the game as a way for the player 
	to obtain certain special influential people (powerups) to help him in the succeeding levels.
	</p>
	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<p>
	The theme of the game revolves around the pun on the title, MoodSwing: the story is about a  romance centered around a swing in a park; the 
	hitpoints of the player is represented as the mood of the city; and the story is deliberately presented, albeit with certain variations in the 
	experience of each player in relation to his decisions to promote interactivity, in a back and forth manner, imitating the motion of a 
	swinging pendulum.
	</p>
	<p>
	The mood of each district (the player's hitpoints at that level) is presented to the player graphically as hue/saturation. Successful 
	uprisings by the citizens will generally lower the mood, as will other things like pollution, hunger, and crime. The mood will also be 
	presented to the player aurally. The mood, key, and tempo of the background music will sync with the mood of the district. As opposed to usual 
	set-ups in typical games, the player's hitpoints will not be full at the beginning of each level. It will be somewhere midway between full and 
	empty – the district will be in a neutral, semi-bad mood initially. The success or failure of the player on each level will depend on how the 
	mood of the district changes. That is, the player wins if the mood reaches a certain "good" level, and the player loses if the mood reaches a 
	certain "bad" level (need not be zero).
	</p>
	<h3 id = "graphics">Graphics</h3>
	<p>
	The graphics of the game will be in full 3D. The player views each district in semi-god mode. The "loading" screens will show a swing swinging 
	back and forth to match the game's theme. During these screens, the condition of the swing (from old and rusty to beautifully fixed) will 
	differ indicating how close the player is to solving the various conflicts present in the MoodSwing city. The graphics style used for the game 
	will ideally be simplistic (maybe minimalistic), or whatever closely matches the theme of the game.
	</p>
	<h3>Audio</h3>
	<p>
	The background music must be flexible enough to be functional as a mood indicator. Hence, the music will not be composed as songs, but as 	
	phrases. These phrases must be composed carefully as to seamlessly connect with each other.
