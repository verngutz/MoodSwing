	Once or twice a week, they would meet at The Swing. There, they played, chatted, and eventually, fell in love with each other.

	External conflict arises parallel to internal conflict. There is war between this and that. There is fissure between the ruling and the ruled,
	there is a difference in color preferences of different worldviews, there is a He and a She.
	</p>
	<p class = "left">
	But suddenly, all of that was gone. In place of The Swing was a huge factory. After The Swing ceased to be, the love ceased to be.

	The vibrance of the city ceased to be. The lush green hues of the trees on the boulevards and the calm blue hues of the blanket above the 
	city turned into the monochromatic gloom of free-flowing carbon. The beautiful symphonies from the young violinists of the little bistros and 
	the sentimental melodies of the blind saxophone player by the park turned into the pounding noise of hammerwork.

	She's a naturalist, a woman of creativity, of emotion, of ecology.

	The citizens began to create uproars. One by one, they walked down the streets, orating and convincing more people to join their army. The 
	revolts spread like wildfire, and the city officials could do nothing but ask the police to silence these angry people.

	What does it feel like to be caught in the middle of these pressing issues? What does it feel like to be the mediator, to swing back and forth 
	between one problem to another? That is what it feels like to play MoodSwing -- going back and forth, solving problems, with the inspiration 
	of the Millenium Development Goals, in order to finally rebuild The Swing, repaint the city, and bring peace to the State and to the World.
