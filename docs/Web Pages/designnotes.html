	<span id = "jump"><a href = "#updates">Jump to Updates</a></span>
	<h3 id = "coopmultiplayer">Note on Cooperative Multiplayer Mode:</h3>
	<p>
	The cooperative multiplayer mode would actually resemble what Microsoft likes to call "coopertition." The players may opt to "compete" with 
	each other by who gets the best game score, or by who makes the most money, or by who has the most volunteers, or by any other criteria which
	the players choose on their own (not stated explicitly by the game, may be hinted at). However, they must still manage the district's mood. 
	This creates a sort of prisoner's dilemma for competitive players.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "independentsandbox">Note on Independent Sandbox Mode:</h3>
	<p>
	Making the Sandbox mode entirely independent from the main city encourages free play and experimenting, giving the player a greater freedom 
	of choice. Making it dependent has negative effects on the gameplay: players will less often attempt to fool around on the sandbox mode if it 
	affects the main city's mood, ruining a potential aspect of fun for the game.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "minigamescrapping">Note on Scrapping the Mini-games:</h3>
	<p>
	Mini-games will likely waste development time and will make the game less elegant and therefore has been scrapped from the game, at the cost 
	of losing a market (assumed to be very small) of casual gamers who are more interested in short arcade games.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "leadrandomization">Note on Removing the Randomization Involved in Choosing which Lead character the Player Focuses on:</h3>
	<p>
	The issue with randomization is that the player who wishes to experience the two entirely opposite sides of the narrative without playing 
	more than two times is not guaranteed to be able to do so.
	</p>
	<h3 id = "folioscrapping">Note on Scrapping the Award Folio/Gallery Feature:</h3>
	<p>
	The award folio/gallery feature will be a useless feature if the rewards aren't visually or aurally pleasing enough to be rewarding at all. 
	This feature is furthermore highly dispensible and will be of least priority (may even be totally scrapped out of the game depending on the 
	time we have available).
	</p>
	<h3 id = "randomdistrict">Note on Randomly Generated Districts</h3>
	<p>
	Randomly generated districts will require some time to implement. It will also be harder to incorporate locale specific plot items. However, 
	we choose to retain this feature because it greatly boosts the game's replay value and discourages strategies relying on memorization.
	</p>
	<h2 id = "updates">Updates</h2>
	<p>
	No updates at the moment
