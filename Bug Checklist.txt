Bug Checklist
-------------

Runtime error occured in MSTower.cs where noted.
The buttons in the clicker build the wrong buildings. (maternal health builds hiv/aids).
You can build another volunteer centre while another one is still under construction. [DONE]
	-I suggest a possibility of queueing another volunteer centre, but John Doe should only be at one place at a time.
Game can be controlled even when underneath other windows.
Citizens are flying (their z-positions are wrong).

-------------------
Things Still Needed
-------------------

Fix MDG score progress bars.
Implement "Game Over" sequences (both for winning and losing).
Implement "Bad Mood" warning.
Fix tooltips.
Add cost information when buying buildings.
Add the pointer to the buy dialog (clicker) and implement the auto-adjust position.
Implement ALL 8 MDG buildings (and maybe one general purpose building).
Implement dialog box for "return to main menu" and "exit" confirmation.
Implement highlighting for hovered buyable buildings.
Fix the HLSL code for lighting.
Hide all the unused screens for now.
Hide debug code and debug onscreen items.
Create necessary documentation (Game Summary, Game Tutorial, and Game Video).
